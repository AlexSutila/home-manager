# home-manager

## Explanation

This is my personal daily-driver setup (or part of it), built on nix home-manager, that I've been using largely for remote work and note taking for course work and personal stuff. I personally do not daily drive nixOS but will typically compliment what ever distro I typically use (something Ubuntu/Debian based) with nix.

I am a big follower of the philosophy that moving your arm to reach for a mouse is giga-cringe so I've aimed to make doing anything terminal related both locally and remotely, editting text both locally and remotely, any kind of note taking (unless you need diagrams then you obviously gotta use a mouse), navigating to/from/between any frequently visited or existing project/repository/directory all as effortless as possible.

Some stuff is still messed up, not everything is migrated - I'll continue this process as I see fit or when other stuff becomes necessary. A couple people were curious, hence I am making it public.
